# Distributed File Sharing System
This is a simple distributed file sharing system based on an asynchronous request-reply model between servers and clients. The system provides the functionalities of publishing a public resource (PUBLISH), sharing a resource on server (SHARE), removing an existing resource (REMOVE), querying a resource by various attributes across servers (QUERY), fetching a shared resource (FETCH) and informing the server of a list of other servers (EXCHANGE). The connections between client and server and between different servers are built on top of SSL connection.
